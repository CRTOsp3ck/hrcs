## **4. Comprehensive Claim Workflow**

### **Claim Statuses & Transitions**

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved → Payment-in-Progress → Paid
          ↓            ↓
      Cancelled    Rejected
```

**Detailed Status Definitions:**

1. **Draft**
   - Initial claim creation state
   - Fully editable by claim owner
   - Not visible to approvers
   - No approval process initiated

2. **Submitted**
   - Claim locked for editing
   - Enters approval workflow
   - Notifications sent to approvers
   - Audit trail begins

3. **Approved**
   - Passed all required approval levels
   - Ready for payment processing
   - Notification sent to finance team
   - Claim amount committed

4. **Rejected**
   - Denied at any approval level
   - Requires justification comments
   - Returnable to draft status
   - Full audit trail maintained

5. **Payment-in-Progress**
   - Approved claims being processed for payment
   - Finance team responsibility
   - Integration with payment systems
   - Tracking of payment status

6. **Paid**
   - Payment completed and confirmed
   - Final status for successful claims
   - Included in financial reporting
   - Archive status for completed claims

7. **Cancelled**
   - Claim withdrawn by submitter
   - Possible before final approval
   - Audit trail maintained
   - No further processing required

### **Approval Workflow Logic**

**Multi-Level Approval Process:**
- Each user group has customizable approval levels (typically 2-3 levels)
- Sequential approval required (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3)
- Each level has designated approvers with specific permissions
- Approval levels can have different financial thresholds
- Automatic escalation for high-value claims

**Approval Permissions Matrix:**
- **Level 1 (Department Head):** Can approve up to $5,000
- **Level 2 (Finance Manager):** Can approve up to $25,000
- **Level 3 (Executive):** Can approve unlimited amounts
- **Special Rules:** Travel expenses require specific approver types
